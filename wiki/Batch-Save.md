---

## How to Use

1. Navigate to any webpage with images
2. Click the **Smart Save Image** icon in your toolbar
3. Go to the **📦 Batch** tab
4. Choose an action:

| Button | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| **All as WebP** | Converts all images to WebP format |
| **All as PNG** | Converts all images to PNG format |
| **Resize 1080px** | Resizes all images to 1080px width |
| **Instagram Ready** | Exports all as 1080×1080 square |
| **YouTube Thumb** | Exports all as 1280×720 |
| **Download ZIP** | Bundles all converted images into a single ZIP file |

## Page Image Scanner

The **⚡ Quick** tab also shows all detected images on the current page:

1. Open the popup → **⚡ Quick** tab
2. Under **🖼️ Page Images**, you'll see the count of detected images
3. Click **🔄 Rescan** if images loaded dynamically (lazy loading, infinite scroll)

---

## Tips

- 💡 **Rescan** after scrolling down on pages with lazy-loaded images
- 💡 **ZIP download** is the most convenient for bulk saving
- 💡 Batch operations use your default quality from [Settings](Settings)
- 💡 Some images may be blocked by CORS — this is a browser security feature, not a bug

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|
| "0 images found" | Try clicking **🔄 Rescan**. Some pages load images dynamically |
| Some images missing | Scroll to load all images first, then rescan |
| Download stuck | Check if Chrome is blocking multiple downloads — allow in settings |
| CORS errors | Some sites block cross-origin image access. Try right-click save instead |
